height between each note: 5px

height between each stanza: 130px

width for each stanza: 750px

sheet size(height,width) = (2339/2px,1656/2px)

height of first stanza(55-95px) so second stanza is (55-95)+130px

each measure's width should be 100px-120px since we need to reserve space for shape and flags.

thus each bit of note should have 25-30px width
